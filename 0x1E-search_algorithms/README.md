# search algorithms

## linear search
> A linear search algorithm is a simple approach for searching an item in a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found.
## binary search 
>Binary search algorithm is an efficient search algorithm that is used to search an item in a sorted array. It divides the array into half at each step and compares the key with the middle element of the array. If the key is smaller than the middle element, the search is performed on the left half of the array, otherwise, the search is performed on the right half of the array.

** time complexity is the relationship between the size of input and time **
** space complexity is the relationship between number of times the loops run
and  required space **
